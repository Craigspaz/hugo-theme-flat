# hugo-theme-blank

This is a theme I personally use.

## Special Thanks

The wordpress theme [Allium](https://wordpress.org/themes/allium/), and [here](https://templatelens.com/allium/) is its home page. I like this theme very much when I'm using wordpress, but I don't have it on hugo, so I try my best to write a theme similar with it. There are many designs in this theme refers to it.

The hugo theme [jane](https://github.com/xianmin/hugo-theme-jane) and [mini](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-mini/), this is my first time to write a hugo theme, I referred this two themes' project structure and way of handling problems.
